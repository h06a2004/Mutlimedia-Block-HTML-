      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language epic action
      thriller film directed by Prashanth Neel and produced by Vijay Kiragandur
      under Hombale Films. The film stars Prabhas in the titular role, alongside
      Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Bobby Simha, Sriya
      Reddy, Ramachandra Raju, John Vijay, Easwari Rao, Tinnu Anand, Devaraj,
      Brahmaji and Mime Gopi. In the fictional dystopian city-state of Khansaar,
      where monarchy still exists, the film follows the friendship between Deva
      (Prabhas), the exiled prince of Khansaar, and Varadha (Prithviraj
      Sukumaran), the current prince of Khansaar. When a coup d'état is planned
      by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha enlists Deva's help
      to become Khansaar's undisputed ruler.

      The film's initial storyline was pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm
      (2014) and is the maiden part of a two-part film.[4] It was officially
      announced in December 2020 under the title Salaar, however, in July 2023,
      its first installment was titled as Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal
      photography commenced in January 2021, and occurred sporadically in
      several legs over nearly three years, before wrapping in late 2023.
      Filming locations included Telangana, Italy and Budapest. Production
      difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX delays,
      postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music is composed by
      Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and editing by Ujwal
      Kulkarni.

      the film, Rocky, a high-ranking mercenary, working for a prominent gold
      mafia in Bombay, seeks power and wealth in order to fulfill his mother's
      promise. Due to his high fame, the leaders of the gold mafia where he

      Fields.

      The film's development began in early 2015, after Neel finished writing
      the screenplay.[citation needed] Filming began two years later, in January
      2017. Most of the film is set in the Kolar Gold Fields and was filmed in
      locales such as Kolar, Mysore, and parts of North Karnataka. The film's
      production was completed in August 2018.[6] Bhuvan Gowda handled the
      cinematography and Srikanth edited the film. Composer Ravi Basrur scored
      the film.[7] The Kannada version of K.G.F: Chapter 1 was released on 20
      December 2018 and the dubbed versions in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and
      Hindi released the next day.[citation needed] The film received positive
      reviews from critics and dialogues from the film became famous worldwide.
      The film did well commercially and earned ₹250 crore (equivalent to ₹334
      crore or US$40 million in 2023) in its entire theatrical run, becoming the
      highest-grossing Kannada film until it was surpassed by its sequel. It
      turned out to be a cult hit.[4] At the 66th National Film Awards, the film
      won two awards for Stunt Choreography and Best Special Effects.[8] At the
      66th Filmfare Awards South, the film won two awards from five nominations,
      including the award for Best Film and Best Actor for Yash.
